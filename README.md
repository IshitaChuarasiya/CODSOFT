# CODSOFT Internship Tasks/ WEB DEVELOPMENT ðŸ’»

Welcome to my CODSOFT repository! This is where I've put all the tasks and projects I did for my CodSoft Web Development Internship (Level 1). The internship was all about getting a good grasp on front-end development, especially with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

ðŸš€ Tasks Overview

âœ…Task 1: Portfolio Website

Here's my personal portfolio website â€“ it shows off my projects, skills, and how to contact me. It's my first time making something that's actually engaging and easy to use!

Here's the lowdown on what I used:

*   I built it with HTML for the basic structure, CSS for making it look good, and JavaScript to make things interactive. It works well on all devices.
*   I went for a modern, simple design. It's easy to get around and see my work.
*   It's also responsive, so it looks great on everything from big screens to phones.

âœ…Task 2: Landing Page

* Developed a responsive landing page using HTML and CSS.

* Focused on layout design, typography, color palette, and proper alignment.

* Implemented a clean, user-friendly structure with headers, sections, and footers.

âœ…Task 3: Calculator

* Created a fully functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* Supported basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

* Styled with CSS for a neat and interactive UI.
